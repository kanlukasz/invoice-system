# Invoice Management System
The project allows creating and managing invoice documents in a web-based application. 
This repository is a place where I have all source code implemented during my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@MaxPronko) video series called Invoice Management System with PHP 8.

## Branches
The `main` branch contains the latest changes of the Invoice Management System project. Each lesson will also have dedicated branches, `eX_start` and `eX_end`. The `X` indicates a lesson number and `e` is a shortcut for an Episode (for example `e1_end` provides source code for the Episode 1). You will find episode numbers in the video thumbnails.
The `start` and `end` indicate source code start and end of an episode. If you want to follow along with me during a video episode, please start with a `eX_start` branch.
